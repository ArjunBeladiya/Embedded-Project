# Embedded Computing Lab Projects

This repository contains my work from the Embedded Computing Laboratory at Hochschule Ravensburg-Weingarten, where I developed and tested robot control and automation tasks using Raspberry Pi, Python, C, and Node.js.

## 📝 Overview of Tasks

- **Task 1:** Setup Raspberry Pi with Raspbian, verify development environments (Python, C, Node.js), test sample scripts.  
- **Task 2:** Program GPIO pushbutton input and LED control, test robot wheel rotation individually.  
- **Task 3:** Implement remote robot control via Node.js webserver, enable obstacle detection and distance feedback.  
- **Task 4:** Develop coordinated control between Python scripts, a C program, and the webserver to achieve line following and distance-based robot control.
